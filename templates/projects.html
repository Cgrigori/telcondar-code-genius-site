            <p>
                At <strong>Telcondar Code Genius LTD</strong>, we don’t just write code—we engineer understanding. One of our showcase projects dives into the intricate world of Formula 1 engineering by transforming a modern F1 car into a living knowledge graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project breaks the car into its fundamental components—<em>chassis, suspension, power unit, aerodynamics, telemetry, and beyond</em>—and maps out how these parts interconnect using a Neo4j graph database. Each part is a node, every functional or mechanical relationship is a connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is an interactive knowledge system that can help fans, students, and engineers alike explore how each element of an F1 car contributes to its speed, control, and reliability.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>🧠 Explore technical relationships like <code>Suspension → Connected To → Chassis</code></li>
                <li>🔍 Learn which parts are standardized by FIA regulations</li>
                <li>⚙️ Understand dependencies between electronics, hydraulics, and mechanical systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Whether you're a racing fan or a systems thinker, this is a perfect example of how technology can bring complex machines to life—one node at a time.
            </p>

            <p>This project combines powerful tools and techniques—including Neo4j for graph modeling, Python and Pandas for data processing, Flask for backend development, and extensive research to structure and refine the dataset.</p>
